        <p>
          When collecting longitudinal data, is it worth collecting intermediate
          data points, versus collecting alarger sample size with only two time
          points. The conclusion is that it is not worth collecting the

          non-linearity is strongly assumed.

          A discussion of when to use fixed effects regression models, versus
          when to use mixed effects regression models (also called "random
          effects regression models" in Econometrics).
        </p>

        <p>
          Their primary argument for fixed effects is omitted variable bias and
          endogeneity at level 2 (group) does not impact level 1 (individual)
          estimates. A secondary argument is that mixed effects models require
          at least 30 groups. (Here's an <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/37647/what-is-the-minimum-recommended-number-of-groups-for-a-random-effects-factor">online

        </p>

        <p>
          They also suggests another alternative, the "within-between mixed
          model", e.g. group-mean centering predictors and also including group
          means as predictors. This models splits within and between completely.
          For example, if you have some predictor <i>X</i>, include in the model
          both <i><span style="text-decoration: overline;">X</span><sub>i</sub></i>
          (the group-level mean) and <i>X<sub>ij</sub> -
          <span style="text-decoration: overline;">X</span><sub>i</sub></i> (the
          variable, group-mean centered).

        <p>

          It is demonstrated that predicted values after fitting a model on
          multiply imputed data can be obtained from the final model, and
          results are equivalent (in the case of linear transformations) or
          almost equivalent (for non-linear transformations) to the results from
          using Rubin's rules on the individual models.
